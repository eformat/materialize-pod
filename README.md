# Materialize on OpenShift

Materialize is a streaming data warehouse. Materialize accepts input data from a variety of streaming sources (e.g. Kafka) and files (e.g. CSVs), and lets you query them using the PostgreSQL dialect of SQL.

This demo uses a realtime event stream from Meetup.com to continually poupulate materalized views that we can query using sql.

The materialize schema is loaded at the start using a kubernetes Job pod.

Checkout `Materialize` here:
- https://materialize.io/docs/install/

Prerequisites:
- access to registry.redhat.io images
- psql client

## Run Meetup.com Demo on OpenShift

Lets take a look at `Meetup.com` live streaming data based on RSVP's to events.

Create application pods in OpenShift:
```
oc new-project materialize
oc apply -f ./materialize-demo.yml
```

Connect to materialize using postgresql client:
```
oc port-forward svc/materialize 6875:6875 &
psql -h localhost -p 6875 materialize
```

See whats popular globally in Meetup.com right now based on live data stream:

## Materialized Views and Data

PVC's used to store streaming event data and materialize data. 

Getting the data into materialize is as easy as:
```
while true; do
  curl --max-time 9999999 -N http://stream.meetup.com/2/rsvps >> /work/meetups/data
done
--
CREATE SOURCE meetups
FROM FILE '/work/meetups/data'
WITH ( tail=true )
FORMAT REGEX '^(?P<meet>\{.*)';
```

Raw data is queryable like postgresql jsonb data;

Checkout `load.sql` Config Map in [`materizlize-demo.yaml`](./materialize-demo.yml) for the created schema magic.
